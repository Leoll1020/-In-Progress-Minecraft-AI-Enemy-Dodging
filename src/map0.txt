# lines with assignment will be executed and change the parameter of map
# all the cells are seperated by '|'
# NO '|' at the left side of the first cell of each row
# but ONE '|' at the right side of the last cell of each row
# Row size and the column size will be checked with ARENA_ROW and ARENA_COL
# 'l' = 'lava', ' ' = 'stone', 'g' = GOAL_TYPE
# the number of 'g' can be less than NUM_GOALS, the difference will be made 
# up by randomly located goals.
